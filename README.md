The Iris dataset is a classic classification problem in machine learning analysis. The dataset provides many classes/features that can be used to classify flower type.
Creator: R.A. Fisher

# Objectives

- Calculate simple statistics
- 5 different plots of the data
- Analyze and build models using scikit-learn

# Note for Julien and Will
```bash
Please proceed to python files folder to find 01_Iris_machine_learning.py
```

# I tried to use the bash script but I made the plots only on python. This will be something I can improve next time! For now, you can only use bash script to see table results.
